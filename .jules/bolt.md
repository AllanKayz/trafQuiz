## 2026-02-10 - [Database & Angular Optimization]
**Learning:** Foundational performance wins in this codebase involve adding missing database indexes on foreign keys in SQLite and optimizing Angular component templates by moving expensive filtering/mapping into computed signals.
**Action:** Always check the initial schema for missing indexes on foreign keys. In Angular, avoid calling methods that perform filtering/mapping directly in templates; use computed signals or memoization instead.

## 2026-04-26 - [IPC Parallelization & Query Aggregation]
**Learning:** IPC handlers often become bottlenecks when they perform multiple sequential database queries. Parallelizing independent queries with `Promise.all` and refactoring sequential query loops into single aggregate SQL queries (e.g., for monthly financial charts) significantly reduces latency.
**Action:** Identify IPC handlers with multiple `await` database calls and use `Promise.all` for independent operations. Replace reporting loops with aggregate queries using `GROUP BY` and conditional `SUM`.

## 2026-05-10 - [SARGable Queries & Date Optimization]
**Learning:** SQLite cannot use indexes on columns that are wrapped in functions like `strftime` or `date()` in a `WHERE` clause. These "non-SARGable" queries force full table scans even if an index exists.
**Action:** Replace date function filters with range-based comparisons (`Op.between`) using pre-calculated UTC date boundaries to ensure indexed 'SEARCH' behavior.
